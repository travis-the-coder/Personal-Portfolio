        <h2><em><b><u>Who am I: </u></b></em></h2>
        <p>My name is Travis Ojeda. I was born in Syracuse, New York on June 18, 1993. I love video games and the consoles that they are played on since I was a kid.
          I love to find ways to get things to work and how to make them better than they were when they first came out. As someone who always wanted to be hands on and be creative, I have found ways to use such skills. As an example of this, I picked up soldering and plastic welding in hopes to repair and modify various things.<br>
          I am an easy going person who wants to have the best life that one could have. I do like to see and understand how certain processes work.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2><em><b><u>Personal Background: </u></b></em></h2>

        <p>
          Since I was young, I have always loved to play video games and wonder what it was like to work for a video game company.
          Starting from the Super Nintendo to the PS5, I love the older consoles now only for their nostalgia but, now, for their 
          ability to be modded and perform at its best.
        </p>

        <p>I have the following consoles in my collection as of now:
          <ul>
            <li>Super Nintendo</li>
            <li>Nintendo Gamecube</li>
            <li>Nintendo 64</li>
            <li>Nintendo Wii</li>
            <li>Nintendo Switch</li>
            <li>Playstation</li>
            <li>Playstation 2</li>
            <li>Playstation 3</li>
            <li>Playstation 4 Pro</li>
            <li>Playstation 5</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Here are the following handheld consoles that I own:
          <ul>
            <li>Gameboy Color</li>
            <li>Gameboy Advanced SP</li>
            <li>Nindendo DS</li>
            <li>Nintendo 3DS XL</li>
            <li>Sony PSP</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
        As I got older, I developed a new like/upcoming passion in the works: <strong><em>programming and repairing</em></strong>.
        When I was in college in 2013, I had taken some courses in HTML, CSS, C Programming, and Java and I really liked it.
        To this day, I try to practice on my spare time by making simple projects for Java and C.
        I found out that as I am working in Amazon, I want to go towards web development instead of IT.

        <br> <br>
        
        As for the repairing aspect, that started when I decided to dive into fixing laptops and iPhones back in 2014. I took the leap in buying some "broken" laptops 
        on Ebay and then when I was done, I would then flip them for some money. On the side, I would replace screens and batteries for iPhones. Fast forward to 2023,
        I repair laptops, iPhones, Android phones, tablets, and desktops. I have not yet dabbled in repairing game consoles but I plans on trying that one day.
        </p>


        <h2><em><b><u>Education:</u></b></em></h2>
        
        <p>I started college at Valencia in 2013 and received my A.S degree in Computer Information Technology in 2017 with the following Certs:
          <ul>
            <li>Computer Programming Specialist (2017)</li>
            <li>Computer Information Technology Specialist (2017)</li>
            <li>Computer Information Data Specialist (2017)</li>
          </ul>


          In 2017, I continued my education in UCF(University of Central Florida) and in 2019, received my Bachelor of Applied Science degree in Applied Science with a 
          specialization in Information Technology.

          <br>

          Now in 2023, I am participating in an upskilling program in a Software Development Course with Correlation-One. 

        </p>


        <h2><em><b><u>Why Correlation-One?: </u></b></em></h2>

        <p>
          I chose to partake in <a href="https://www.correlation-one.com/" target="_blank">Correlation One's</a> Software Development course for the following reasons:

        <ul>
          <li>To have better career opportunities </li>
          <li>To help me be financially free</li>
          <li>Help me get back into programming</li>
          <li>To help me create a better future for me and those around me</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          I made the commitment to not only relearn old web development skills through Correlation-One but, to learn new ones as well. My inspiration to take the software development course
          came from the want to get a career opportunity outside of Amazon. Don't get the wrong impression, I love being in IT with Amazon and the company has taught me many
          skills and the opportunities that the company has given me(like being able to take this course), but I am at the point where I am basically burnt out every day I go
          to work. When I seen this show up in Career Choice, I decided to jump on it immediately and give Correlation-One a chance. I have really enjoyed the courses and I am already slowly
          getting back into programming again. Some of the things that I learned that was cool to learn was the favicons, emojis, and forms. Hopefully as this course progresses, I can learn javascript,
          Bootstrap or Angular, working on projects as a team, and designing web pages.
